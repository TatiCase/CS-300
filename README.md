What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?`<br>
I felt that the main objective for the projects in this course was to research,
select, and implement the correct and convenient data structures for a given set of data.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
   The first step when approaching this problem is to thoroughly analyze your given data set. You must decipher how many pieces of information each piece of data has. This way you can select an appropriate data structure.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
I usually re-read the Zybook chapter or looked up YouTube videos that walked me through the coding process.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project gave me a better understanding of the data structures, vector, linked list, hash table, and binary search tree. I can now analyze sets of data and choose appropriate data structures. This will help me organize data in future projects.
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
It has given me the knowledge and insight needed to choose appropriate data structures that will allow me to input more data, delete data, and edit data when necessary.
